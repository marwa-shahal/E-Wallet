#Project Name & Pitch

E-Wallet APP
E-Wallet and transaction manager Where you can add wallets in different types of currencies and manage your incomes and outcomes built with React, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.


#Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users may create and manage their wallets but the data has to be persisted somewhere (which is not the case currently) - therefore I'm planning to hook it up with Firebase in the near future.

#Reflection

This app was build as a one of front-end bootcamps hosted by re:coded. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features all of which has been achieved by leveraging react, react-router-5.0.
